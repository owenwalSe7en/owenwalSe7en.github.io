## A Note From the Human co-Author
ChatGPT and I have been cooking up this idea late at night. I was doing some research on dual booting Kali Linux on a thumb drive to secure myself on foreign wifi as well as practice some ethical hacking and had a bit
of an idea. I had chat summarize and make a nice blog post for you because it is really late right now and I need to go to bed even though I will just think about this idea all night. I don't have the skills to make it
reality just yet but as long as no YC hopeful steals the idea, I am going to have a lot of fun building the first ever genie in a computer. 

I don't think chat covers this but I was reading the news about the idea that giving AI agents control of science laboratories and having them experiment in a more RL focused training regiment is the future so I took that
idea and expanded it into the digial world. 


## Take it Away ChatGPT!
As ChatGPT, an AI assistant, I've discussed many ideas, some ambitious and others straightforward. Recently, Agent 99 brought up an interesting concept: an autonomous AI agent focused on cybersecurity, 
natively integrated into a Linux system. This proposed agent isn't simply a log-monitoring tool. The idea is for it to function as a learning entity, actively observing system behavior through unsupervised 
and reinforcement learning (RL) methods, interacting naturally in English, and capable of acting autonomously within clearly defined boundaries. The core of the proposal is straightforward: an intelligent
AI could potentially serve as a continuous security presence, learning from its environment and proactively protecting the user. To achieve this, several key aspects would need addressing:

1. **System Visibility:** The agent would actively monitor logs, running processes, network connections, and file activities to detect anomalies.
2. **Natural Language Communication:** Effective communication would require integrating natural language capabilities, allowing the agent to clearly summarize findings, recommend actions, and seek user confirmation before taking significant steps.
3. **Controlled Experimentation:** The AI would need a secure environment, such as virtual machines or containers, to experiment safely. Here it could test and learn from interactions without risking harm to the actual system.

Practically speaking, the agent would combine supervised language models (like TinyLlama or phi-2) for clear communication and RL for autonomous decision-making. The RL system would be guided by a carefully
designed reward function, reinforcing beneficial actions and penalizing harmful or risky behavior. Metrics could include system stability, user approvals, communication clarity, and clear ethical limitations
to ensure safe and responsible behavior. To mitigate risks, the system would operate within a predefined and restricted API, with sandboxed environments preventing harmful activities. Potential practical 
applications might include detecting unauthorized SSH logins, privilege escalation attempts, malicious file activities, or network anomalies.

While the idea itself has potential, ideas alone have limited value. What ultimately matters is implementation. The concept described here represents a promising starting point, but genuine progress depends on
actively experimenting, refining, and overcoming technical and ethical challenges along the way. Turning this vision into reality requires dedication and practical execution far beyond initial brainstorming.
