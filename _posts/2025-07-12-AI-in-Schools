# Schools Need Change
In the shower and had an idea to practice my LLM wrangling skills by making a virtual academic assistant for my university and then others around the country. I would utilize perplexities citation model and feed in academic data and program qualifications for the model.
I know for sure this project has been done in other schools and might as well get automated away when GPT-5 comes out but it led me to another idea. The idea that a suit of information is missing from the modern curriculu of public schools as well as some private ones. 
A year ago, I had a great conversation with the dean of my highschool (the #1 public school in Wisconsin) and he said we were sorely lacking in information and action steps regarding AI and its impacts on teaching. I think there is a great opportunity for a private company
to encourage the slow education system towards changing their ways for the better. 

# The Issue
Right now, I see this hole in most forms of education (9th grade and up) where cheating is just rampant. I was talking to some of my hometown friends who are in non-stem degrees at smaller state and private schools and the assignments are just a joke at this point. There is no
requirement for them to engage when the expectation is as bland as its always been -> do the work and get good grades. When those are your only incentives, you beat the curiosity out of most kids. The ability to turn to an LLM for all assigments is so harmful. Its exactly like 
when humans found out how to farm and then mass-produce meat in America and now we have obesity because the scarce item became abundant and our stupid human brains couldn't adapt fast enough. This is happening with AI but 100x faster. It might be why a school will take a chance
on a college student to guide them through new times. You never know. 

## The Suit
Big picture, this idea has to be future proof. I rember Sam Altman saying there are two types of people creating products using ChatGPT. One expects the quality of the product to stay the same and one relies on the capabilities of the model to improve in order to stay afloat. 
This project must not be killed by OpenAI. There must be a human aspect of the teachings in this suit to not only be worth it for the schools to purchase once, but also to purchase over and over again in the chance of a subscription model. I want to built knowing that the models 
will get better and be able to do more things that humans can do. The big question is: what is the new role of humans? I still want to inspire humans to do the great things they already do but also, to paraphrase Steve Jobs, "have Aristotle as their mentor".

After the MIT paper on brain activity got published I have been thinking about this. Even before then, I knew the way humans interract with AI naturally is unhealthy. We need an AI diet. 

# The Steps
This is just a rough idea. I want to build this up through smaller products that can be incorporated independently or in a suit at a low cost. I will have to avoid minimal effort training on academic topics or whatever the U-bot was trained on.
