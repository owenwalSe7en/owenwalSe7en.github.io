Okay, first post, and it's about a book I just finished: The Circle by Dave Eggers. This book is confusing, and Eggers fails in many ways to create characters who reflect reality without sacrificing his message.

# The Characters - My Key Complaint
My mom always taught me respect, so I had to get that generally positive view out of the way, but oh lor,d the characters. 

If creating insufferable characters for this book was the intended goal, Eggers definitely went far beyond the finish line. The characters here are just too naive given the premise of the Circle, a giant Meta/Google/Tencent-like tech company. I can't wrap my head around every character being so oblivious to the fascist surveillance state unfolding right in front of them.

If Eggers were more talented, he would have found a better way to get people on board with this egregious social overhaul than simply "Oh, they just love tech," or "They're just pressured by their jobs to like it."

Also, who exactly is watching Mae's streams? By the end of the book, tens of millions of people are tuning into her livestreams in the middle of the workday! That's almost 10% of the entire country watching her go to an aquarium or view a tech product launch. I understand Eggers based it on modern-day live-streaming, but the kids watching those ridiculous streamers aren't old enough to hop into a car and chase poor Mercer to his death. It takes away from the immersion and genuinely frustrates me. A show like Succession angers me in a good way because the moral rifts and rudeness are justified by the characters' backgrounds and upbringing. In The Circle, it's just shoehorned in there. How do you have such a concentration of intellectual talent with such a complete lack of morals? How do so many people go along with the obvious torment inflicted upon personal lives and privacy? 

This entire crusade of truth is because Bailey called the world's bluff on secrets being lies. You're telling me that not one person in that giant tech company could come up with an example where a lie is good? I thought of one in less than a second of hearing that dumb slogan (nazis come to your house and ask if you are harboring jews and you are). 

For me, immersion is everything. Orwell achieved it perfectly, though he also had an advantage since he was writing within a distant timeframe, not bound by the narrative restrictions Eggers faced. This is partly why I'm a bigger fan of movies than books. We don't live in words; we live in actions, facial expressions, and tone. While these can be communicated through written text, the very fact that it is written often feels unnatural.

I'll update after I finish the sequel, The Every, which hopefully includes more dissenting voices.
