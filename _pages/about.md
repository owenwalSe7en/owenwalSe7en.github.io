My name is Owen Wallace. I have made an official decision to create this blog because I can type faster than I can write. Also, I have noticed that my thoughts get fleshed out and more detailed when I compose them outside the medium of origination. 

This website is as much for you, the reader, as it is for me.

Thanks for reading
